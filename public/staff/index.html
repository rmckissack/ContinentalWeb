    <h1>Hello.</h1>
    <h2>There are some changes to the software.</h2>
    <p>It works the same way you just have to login first.</p>
    <p>Here is what you need to do.</P>
      <ol>
        <li>go to the address line at the top of this page and replace 10.0.0.110/public/staff with just 10.0.0.110</li>
        <ul>
          <li>or <a href="http://10.0.0.110">click here to go to the 10.0.0.110 address</a></li>
        </ul>
        <li>now click on the Login button</li>
        <li>the user name is 'sorter', all lower case, no quotes</li>
        <li>the password in 'abc123', again no quotes and all lower case</li>
        <li>you should now see the acreen that has the button across the top including the one for sorting</li>
        </ol>

        <p>I will fix it so the computer automatically opens to the login page the next time I am in there.</p>
